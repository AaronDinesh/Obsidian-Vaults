	- Talked to Irina from **OpenMined**: "I think there could be a few impactful projects that live under Openminedâ€™s repository we can think of and they can have a high degree of ownership, but barrier to contributing to PySyft or Syft (our new product) is really high, we are trying to modularise any further work, so 90% of work lives in other repos, not the main ones."
	- Elvan (FFC) is GSoC 2025, working with the Scala Foundation on LLMs

	- **CERN**: "thanks a lot for your interest in contributing to open source! We're an umbrella organization with many different project, and I've asked around who could be interested in a project like this. There's at least one which could be a great fit - you should get a mail from them soon."
