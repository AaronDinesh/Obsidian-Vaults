**Part 1 â€“ Long Questions**

**1. Present how to perform geometrical transformations of a digital image? Take the example of a translation of a non-integer number of pixels.**

Geometrical transformations of a digital image involve altering the spatial arrangement of pixels. This is a pre-processing step in image analysis. The core idea is to map the coordinates of pixels from the input image to new coordinates in the output image. For transformations involving non-integer pixel locations, interpolation is necessary to determine the intensity value at the new location.

For a translation of a non-integer number of pixels, consider a point with original coordinates $(x, y)$ in the input image. A translation shifts this point to a new location $(u, v)$ in the output image. The relationship between the original and new coordinates for a simple translation is given by:
$u = x + t_x$
$v = y + t_y$
where $t_x$ and $t_y$ are the translation amounts in the x and y directions, respectively.

If $t_x$ or $t_y$ are not integers, the new coordinates $(u, v)$ will not align perfectly with the discrete pixel grid of the output image. To determine the intensity value at $(u, v)$ in the output image, we need to use interpolation. Instead of directly mapping from input to output, it is often more practical to perform the inverse mapping: for each pixel $(u, v)$ in the output grid, calculate its corresponding location $(x, y)$ in the input image using the inverse transformation:
$x = u - t_x$
$y = v - t_y$

Since $(x, y)$ will generally be a non-integer location, we need to estimate the intensity at this location in the input image based on the values of its neighboring pixels. This is where interpolation comes in. Common interpolation methods include:

*   **Nearest Neighbor Interpolation:** The intensity of the output pixel is assigned the intensity of the nearest pixel in the input image. This is the simplest method but can result in a blocky appearance.
*   **Bilinear Interpolation:** The intensity of the output pixel is a weighted average of the intensities of the four nearest pixels in the input image. The weights are determined by the distance of the point $(x, y)$ from these four pixels. This method produces smoother results than nearest neighbor.
*   **Bicubic Interpolation:** This method uses a weighted average of the sixteen nearest pixels. It is computationally more expensive but generally produces the smoothest results.

The provided slides illustrate the concept of translation with non-integer shifts and highlight the need for interpolation. Specifically, slide 12 shows the forward and inverse translation equations and a visual representation of how a grid is shifted, requiring interpolation to determine pixel values at the new locations.

**2. What is image restoration? On this context what is inverse filtering and what is a Wiener filter?**

Image restoration is the process of recovering a degraded image to its original state by compensating for the effects of known degradations. These degradations can be caused by factors such as noise, blur (due to camera motion or defocus), or atmospheric turbulence. The goal of image restoration is to estimate the original image based on the degraded image and a model of the degradation process. Slide 36 introduces image restoration as inverting non-wanted effects and highlights deconvolution as a typical application.

The provided slides model the degraded image $f_o(x, y)$ as the convolution of the original image $f_i(x, y)$ with a degradation filter $h_D(x, y)$, plus additive noise $n(x, y)$:
$f_o(x, y) = f_i(x, y) ** h_D(x, y) + n(x, y)$
where '**' denotes convolution.

**Inverse Filtering:**
Inverse filtering is a simple approach to image restoration that attempts to reverse the effect of the degradation filter $h_D$. The idea is to convolve the degraded image $f_o$ with an inverse filter $h_R$ such that the result approximates the original image $f_i$. In the frequency domain, this corresponds to multiplying the Fourier transform of the degraded image $F_o(\omega_x, \omega_y)$ by the reciprocal of the Fourier transform of the degradation filter $H_D(\omega_x, \omega_y)$:
$\hat{F}_i(\omega_x, \omega_y) = \frac{F_o(\omega_x, \omega_y)}{H_D(\omega_x, \omega_y)}$
Substituting the model of the degraded image in the frequency domain ($F_o = F_i H_D + N$), we get:
$\hat{F}_i(\omega_x, \omega_y) = \frac{F_i(\omega_x, \omega_y) H_D(\omega_x, \omega_y) + N(\omega_x, \omega_y)}{H_D(\omega_x, \omega_y)} = F_i(\omega_x, \omega_y) + \frac{N(\omega_x, \omega_y)}{H_D(\omega_x, \omega_y)}$

Slide 37 explains this process and shows the equation in the frequency domain. The limitation of inverse filtering is that it is highly sensitive to noise, especially at frequencies where $H_D(\omega_x, \omega_y)$ is small. Dividing by a small number can greatly amplify the noise component, leading to a poor restoration. Slide 39 visually demonstrates how noise can be amplified in inverse filtering.

**Wiener Filter:**
The Wiener filter is a more sophisticated approach to image restoration that takes into account the presence of noise. It aims to find a filter $h_R$ that minimizes the mean squared error between the estimated original image $\hat{f}_i$ and the actual original image $f_i$. Assuming the original image and the noise are uncorrelated random processes with known power spectra, the Wiener filter in the frequency domain is given by:
$H_R(\omega_x, \omega_y) = \frac{|H_D(\omega_x, \omega_y)|^2}{|H_D(\omega_x, \omega_y)|^2 + \frac{P_N(\omega_x, \omega_y)}{P_i(\omega_x, \omega_y)}} \frac{1}{H_D(\omega_x, \omega_y)}$
where $P_N(\omega_x, \omega_y)$ is the power spectrum of the noise and $P_i(\omega_x, \omega_y)$ is the power spectrum of the original image. Slide 45 provides this formula.

The Wiener filter acts as a compromise between inverse filtering and simply smoothing the image. At frequencies where the signal-to-noise ratio ($P_i/P_N$) is high, the Wiener filter approximates the inverse filter. At frequencies where the signal-to-noise ratio is low, the Wiener filter attenuates the signal, acting more like a low-pass filter, thus reducing the amplified noise. Slide 46 summarizes the conclusions about the Wiener filter, noting its adaptive band-pass behavior.

**3. Explain what object labeling is and the algorithm to implement it.**

Object labeling, also known as connected component labeling, is a process in image analysis where connected regions of pixels sharing a common property (e.g., intensity value in a binary image) are identified and assigned a unique label. This process effectively groups pixels belonging to the same object. Slide 15 of Lecture 2 simply introduces the concept of object labeling with an image example without detailing the algorithm.

A common algorithm to implement object labeling is the two-pass algorithm:

**Pass 1:**
1.  Initialize a label counter to 1.
2.  Iterate through the image pixel by pixel, typically from top-left to bottom-right.
3.  If the current pixel is a foreground pixel (belongs to an object) and has not been labeled yet:
    *   Check its labeled neighbors (usually the ones above and to the left, depending on the connectivity considered - 4-connectivity or 8-connectivity).
    *   If none of the neighbors are labeled, assign a new unique label to the current pixel and increment the label counter.
    *   If one or more neighbors are labeled, assign the smallest label among the labeled neighbors to the current pixel. Record the equivalence between different labels if labeled neighbors have different labels.

**Pass 2:**
1.  Iterate through the image pixel by pixel again.
2.  For each labeled pixel, replace its current label with the representative label of its equivalence class. The equivalence classes are determined during the first pass based on the recorded equivalences between labels.

After the second pass, all connected pixels belonging to the same object will have the same unique label.

While the slides do not explicitly detail this algorithm, the concept of identifying connected components is fundamental to object labeling as introduced on slide 15 of Lecture 2.

**4. What are the main principles of edge detection, and the two main families of methods to do edge detection? Present typical methods for each family.**

Edge detection is a fundamental technique in image processing used to identify boundaries of objects within an image by detecting significant local changes in pixel intensity. These changes often correspond to discontinuities in depth, surface orientation, material properties, or scene illumination. The main principle is to find locations where the image brightness changes sharply. Slide 20 of Lecture 2 introduces edge detection as searching for sharp edges and describes a sharp transition of intensity as a step function.

The two main families of methods for edge detection are:

1.  **Gradient-Based Methods (First-Order Derivative Methods):** These methods detect edges by looking for maxima in the first derivative of the image intensity. The gradient of an image measures the rate and direction of the strongest intensity change. Edges are typically located where the gradient magnitude is high.
    *   **Principle:** Calculate the gradient of the image (usually using convolution with a kernel). The magnitude of the gradient indicates the strength of the edge, and the direction of the gradient is perpendicular to the edge.
    *   **Typical Methods:**
        *   **Robert Operator:** A simple 2x2 kernel that computes the sum of the squares of the differences between diagonal pixels. Slide 21 of Lecture 2 shows the kernels for the Robert operator.
        *   **Prewitt Operator:** Uses two 3x3 kernels to compute the gradient in the horizontal and vertical directions. Slide 22 of Lecture 2 shows the kernels.
        *   **Sobel Operator:** Similar to the Prewitt operator but uses different weights in the kernels, giving more importance to the central pixels. Slide 22 of Lecture 2 shows the kernels.

2.  **Second-Order Derivative Methods (Zero-Crossing Methods):** These methods detect edges by looking for zero crossings in the second derivative of the image intensity. A zero crossing occurs where the second derivative changes sign.
    *   **Principle:** Compute a measure of the second derivative, such as the Laplacian. Edges are located at the points where the second derivative crosses zero. These methods are sensitive to noise, so the image is typically smoothed before applying the second derivative operator.
    *   **Typical Methods:**
        *   **Laplacian Operator:** A 2D isotropic measure of the second spatial derivative. It highlights regions of rapid intensity change.
        *   **Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG):** Combines Gaussian smoothing with the Laplacian operator to reduce noise sensitivity. Edges are detected at the zero crossings of the LoG filtered image. Slide 23 of Lecture 2 introduces the LoG as a method for edge detection based on zero-crossing of the second derivative after Gaussian filtering. The convolution of the image with the LoG filter is equivalent to convolving the image with a Gaussian and then applying the Laplacian. Slide 24 of Lecture 2 highlights this property.

**5. What are the 4 main operators of binary mathematical morphology? Explain each of them.**

Mathematical morphology is a theory and technique for analyzing and processing geometrical structures in images, primarily based on set theory. It uses a structuring element to probe the image. The four main operators of binary mathematical morphology are:

1.  **Dilation:** Dilation expands the boundaries of foreground objects (usually white pixels) in a binary image. It adds pixels to the boundaries. Slide 29 of Lecture 2 defines dilation as $X \oplus B = \{c \in E \text{ t.q. } c = a + b \text{ avec } a \in X, b \in B\} = \bigcup_{b \in B} (X)_b$. Intuitively, for each pixel in the foreground object, the structuring element is centered on that pixel, and all pixels covered by the structuring element are included in the dilated image. Slide 30 of Lecture 2 visually demonstrates the effect of dilation, showing how the shape grows.
    *   **Effect:** Enlarges objects, fills in small holes and breaks in contours.

2.  **Erosion:** Erosion shrinks the boundaries of foreground objects in a binary image. It removes pixels from the boundaries. Slide 29 of Lecture 2 defines erosion as $X \ominus B = \{c \in E \text{ t.q. } \forall b \in B, c + b \in X\} = \bigcap_{b \in B} (X)_{-b}$. Intuitively, a pixel is kept in the eroded image only if the structuring element, when centered on that pixel, is completely contained within the foreground object. Slide 30 of Lecture 2 visually demonstrates the effect of erosion, showing how the shape shrinks.
    *   **Effect:** Shrinks objects, removes small objects and thin lines, and can break apart connected objects.

3.  **Opening:** Opening is a composite operation consisting of an erosion followed by a dilation using the same structuring element. Slide 35 of Lecture 2 defines opening as $X \circ B = (X \ominus B) \oplus B$.
    *   **Effect:** Removes small objects and thin lines, while largely preserving the shape and size of larger objects. It smooths the contour of an object from the inside. Slide 35 of Lecture 2 shows a visual representation.

4.  **Closing:** Closing is a composite operation consisting of a dilation followed by an erosion using the same structuring element. Slide 35 of Lecture 2 defines closing as $X \bullet B = (X \oplus B) \ominus B$.
    *   **Effect:** Fills small holes and gaps within foreground objects, while largely preserving the shape and size of larger objects. It smooths the contour of an object from the outside. Slide 35 of Lecture 2 shows a visual representation.

These four operators are fundamental building blocks for many other morphological operations.

**6. What are the Fourier descriptors?**

Fourier descriptors are a method used to represent and describe the shape of an object's boundary (contour) in a digital image using the coefficients of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the boundary's coordinates. This approach transforms the 2D spatial information of the contour into a set of complex numbers that characterize the shape in the frequency domain. Slide 22 of Lecture 3 introduces Fourier descriptors as using the Fourier transform of the contours.

The process typically involves the following steps:
1.  Trace the boundary of the object and obtain a sequence of coordinates $(x_k, y_k)$ for $k = 0, 1, \ldots, N-1$, where $N$ is the number of points on the contour.
2.  Represent these coordinates as a sequence of complex numbers $u_k = x_k + j y_k$.
3.  Compute the Discrete Fourier Transform of the sequence $u_k$. The resulting complex coefficients, $f_l$, are the Fourier descriptors. Slide 23 of Lecture 3 provides the formula for the DFT:
    $f_l = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} u_k e^{-j \frac{2\pi kl}{N}}$

The key properties of Fourier descriptors that make them useful for shape analysis are their invariance to common image transformations:

*   **Translation:** Shifting the object in the image only affects the first Fourier descriptor ($f_0$), which represents the centroid of the shape. The remaining descriptors are invariant to translation. Slide 25 of Lecture 3 explains this.
*   **Rotation:** Rotating the object rotates the phase of all Fourier descriptors by a constant amount. The magnitudes of the descriptors remain unchanged, making them invariant to rotation. Slide 26 of Lecture 3 explains this.
*   **Scaling:** Changing the size of the object scales the magnitudes of all Fourier descriptors by the same factor. The ratios of the magnitudes of the descriptors are invariant to scaling. Slide 27 of Lecture 3 explains this.
*   **Starting Point:** Changing the starting point of tracing the contour affects the phase of the Fourier descriptors but not their magnitudes. Slide 28 of Lecture 3 explains this.

Since the first few Fourier descriptors capture the overall shape characteristics (lower frequencies), and the later descriptors capture finer details (higher frequencies), using a subset of the Fourier descriptors allows for a compact representation of the shape that is robust to noise and minor variations while being invariant to translation, rotation, and scaling. Slide 30 of Lecture 3 shows that the first descriptors contain the majority of the shape information.

**7. What are the Fourier descriptors?**
This is the same as question 6. Please refer to the answer for question 6.

**8. What is a Freeman code?**

A Freeman code, also known as a chain code, is a method for representing the boundary of a shape in a digital image as a sequence of directional codes. It is a lossless compression method for binary images based on tracing the image contours. The process involves selecting a starting point on the boundary and then moving along the contour, recording the direction of each step relative to the previous point using a predefined set of directional codes. Slide 11 of Lecture 3 introduces the chain code or Freeman code.

The most common Freeman chain code uses 8-connectivity, where each step is encoded by one of eight possible directions (0-7). Slide 11 of Lecture 3 illustrates the 8-connectivity directions and their corresponding codes.

The sequence of codes forms a chain that describes the shape of the boundary. While the code itself is sensitive to the starting point, rotation, and scaling of the object, these variations can be addressed by normalizing the chain code (e.g., by cyclic shifting to a canonical starting point, or by using the first difference of the chain code).

Freeman codes are useful for compact representation and analysis of shapes, particularly in applications like optical character recognition. The provided slides mention the notion of edition distance between two chains for comparing shapes represented by chain codes, which reflects the minimum number of operations (insertion, suppression, substitution) needed to transform one chain into another. Slide 12 and 13 of Lecture 3 discuss edition distance.

**9. What is a morphological skeleton?**

A morphological skeleton is a thin representation of a shape or binary image that lies along the medial axis of the object. It is computed using morphological operators, typically erosion and opening. The skeleton captures the essential structural characteristics of the shape, such as its connectivity, topology, and some information about its size and orientation, while reducing the shape to a set of thin lines. Slide 18 of Lecture 3 introduces the morphological skeleton.

One way to compute the morphological skeleton $S(X)$ of a shape $X$ using morphological opening is given by LantuÃ©joul's formula:
$S(X) = \bigcup_{r=0}^{N} S_r(X)$
where $S_r(X) = (X \ominus rB) - (X \ominus rB) \circ B$, $X \ominus rB$ is the erosion of $X$ by $r$ iterations of a structuring element $B$, and $(X \ominus rB) \circ B$ is the opening of the eroded shape by $B$. The union is taken over all $r$ where $X \ominus rB$ is non-empty. Slide 18 of Lecture 3 provides this formula. This formulation identifies the skeleton points as those that are the centers of maximal disks (or structuring elements) that fit inside the shape.

Alternatively, the skeleton can be computed by iteratively thinning the shape until only the central lines remain, while preserving the shape's topology.

The skeleton can be used for shape analysis, such as pattern recognition (like optical character recognition), as it provides a more compact representation than the full boundary or the original shape. The original shape can often be reconstructed from its skeleton and the distance of each skeleton point to the boundary.

**10. What is a Bayesian classifier? (principle, advantages & limitations, application to Gaussian cases)**

A Bayesian classifier is a probabilistic approach to classification that assigns a given input feature vector to the class with the highest probability. It is based on Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probability of a class given a feature vector to the prior probability of the class and the likelihood of the feature vector given the class.

**Principle:**
Given a feature vector $x$ and a set of classes $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_M$, the Bayesian classifier calculates the posterior probability $P(w_i | x)$ for each class $w_i$ and assigns $x$ to the class that maximizes this probability. According to Bayes' theorem:
$P(w_i | x) = \frac{p(x | w_i) P(w_i)}{p(x)}$
where $p(x | w_i)$ is the likelihood of observing feature vector $x$ given class $w_i$, $P(w_i)$ is the prior probability of class $w_i$, and $p(x)$ is the probability of observing feature vector $x$. Since $p(x)$ is the same for all classes, the decision rule simplifies to assigning $x$ to the class that maximizes $p(x | w_i) P(w_i)$. This is also known as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) decision rule. Slide 7 and 8 of Lecture 5 explain the principle and Bayes' rule.

The decision surface between two classes $w_i$ and $w_j$ is defined by the points $x$ where $P(w_i | x) = P(w_j | x)$, or equivalently, $p(x | w_i) P(w_i) = p(x | w_j) P(w_j)$. Taking the logarithm, we get $\ln(p(x | w_i)) + \ln(P(w_i)) = \ln(p(x | w_j)) + \ln(P(w_j))$. This equation defines the decision surface. Slide 10 of Lecture 5 explains the generalization to $n$ classes and the decision surface.

**Advantages:**
*   Provides a principled way to incorporate prior knowledge about the probability of each class.
*   Can handle multi-class problems naturally.
*   If the true probability distributions are known, the Bayesian classifier is optimal in minimizing the classification error rate. Slide 9 of Lecture 5 illustrates how the Bayesian classifier minimizes classification errors in a 1D example.

**Limitations:**
*   Requires knowledge or estimation of the prior probabilities $P(w_i)$ and the likelihood functions $p(x | w_i)$. Estimating these probabilities accurately, especially in high-dimensional feature spaces with limited data, can be challenging.
*   Assumes that the features are independent in some versions (like Naive Bayes), which might not always hold true in practice.

**Application to Gaussian Cases:**
A common assumption in Bayesian classification is that the likelihood functions $p(x | w_i)$ follow a Gaussian (Normal) distribution for each class.

*   **1D Case:** For a single feature $x$, the likelihood is $p(x | w_i) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_i^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2}}$, where $\mu_i$ and $\sigma_i^2$ are the mean and variance of the feature for class $w_i$. Slide 11 of Lecture 5 provides this formula.
*   **lD Case (Multivariate Gaussian):** For a feature vector $x$ of dimension $l$, the likelihood is $p(x | w_i) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{l/2} |\Sigma_i|^{1/2}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(x-\mu_i)^T \Sigma_i^{-1} (x-\mu_i)}$, where $\mu_i$ is the mean vector and $\Sigma_i$ is the covariance matrix for class $w_i$. Slide 11 of Lecture 5 provides this formula.

In the Gaussian case, the discriminant function $g_i(x) = \ln(p(x | w_i)) + \ln(P(w_i))$ can be derived. Slide 12 of Lecture 5 shows the derivation. The form of the decision surface depends on whether the covariance matrices $\Sigma_i$ are the same for all classes or different.

*   **If $\Sigma_i = \Sigma$ for all $i$:** The quadratic terms in the discriminant function cancel out, and the decision surfaces are linear (hyperplanes). Slide 14 of Lecture 5 explains this case. If $\Sigma = \sigma^2 I$ (diagonal with equal variances), the decision hyperplanes are perpendicular to the vector connecting the means of the two classes. Slide 15 and 16 of Lecture 5 illustrate this.
*   **If $\Sigma_i$ are different:** The quadratic terms remain, and the decision surfaces are quadratic (hyperquadrics). Slide 13 of Lecture 5 shows an example with different covariance matrices resulting in quadratic decision boundaries. Slide 17 of Lecture 5 further discusses the case of different covariance matrices.

This is the same as question 10. Please refer to the answer for question 10.

**Part 2 â€“ Short Questions**

**1. What is a Median filter?**

A median filter is a non-linear digital filtering technique used primarily for noise reduction in images. It works by replacing the intensity value of each pixel with the median of the intensity values of its neighboring pixels within a defined window or kernel. The median is calculated by sorting the pixel values in the window in numerical order and selecting the middle value.

**Source:** Slides 29, 30 (Image analysis and Pattern Recognition, Lecture 1),

**2. What is a Median filter?**
This is the same as question 1 in Part 2. Please refer to the answer for question 1 in Part 2.

**3. What is the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) method for edge detection? (this question cannot be taken if question 4 is taken in Part 1)**

The Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) is a method for edge detection that combines Gaussian smoothing with the Laplacian operator. The image is first smoothed using a Gaussian filter to reduce noise sensitivity. Then, the Laplacian operator is applied to the smoothed image. Edges are detected at the zero crossings of the resulting output, which correspond to locations of rapid intensity change. The convolution of the image with the LoG filter is equivalent to convolving the image with a Gaussian and then applying the Laplacian. Slide 23 and 24 of Lecture 2 explain this.

**Source:** Slides 23, 24 (Image analysis and Pattern Recognition, Lecture 2),

**4. How do we calculate the axes of inertia of a binary object?**

The axes of inertia of a binary object are the principal axes of the object, which are determined by the distribution of its pixels. Calculating the axes of inertia involves computing the central moments of the object and then analyzing its covariance matrix.

1.  **Calculate Central Moments:** For a binary image where $f(k,l)$ is 1 for foreground pixels and 0 for background pixels, the central moments $\mu_{i,j}$ are calculated based on the coordinates $(k,l)$ relative to the object's center of gravity $(\bar{k}, \bar{l})$. Slide 40 of Lecture 3 provides the formula for central moments.
    $\mu_{i,j} = \sum_k \sum_l (k-\bar{k})^i (l-\bar{l})^j f(k,l)$
2.  **Form the Covariance Matrix:** A 2x2 covariance matrix (or scattering matrix) $T$ is formed using the second-order central moments: $\mu_{2,0}$, $\mu_{0,2}$, and $\mu_{1,1}$. Slide 45 of Lecture 3 shows this matrix.
    $T = \begin{pmatrix} \mu_{2,0} & \mu_{1,1} \\ \mu_{1,1} & \mu_{0,2} \end{pmatrix}$
3.  **Compute Eigenvectors:** The axes of inertia are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix $T$. Slide 46 of Lecture 3 states that the axes of inertia are the eigenvectors of T.
4.  **Compute Eigenvalues:** The eigenvalues associated with the eigenvectors represent the variance of the shape projected onto the corresponding axes. Slide 46 of Lecture 3 states that the eigenvalues express the variance of the shape projected on the axes of inertia.

The direction of the principal axis of inertia can also be determined by the angle $\alpha$ related to the moments. Slide 46 of Lecture 3 provides the formula for this angle.

**5. What is an Euclidean distance classifier?**

An Euclidean distance classifier is a type of classifier that assigns an unknown feature vector to the class whose mean (centroid) is closest to the feature vector in terms of Euclidean distance. This classifier can be seen as a simplified Bayesian classifier under the assumption that all classes have the same diagonal covariance matrix with equal variances ($\Sigma_i = \sigma^2 I$) and equal prior probabilities. In this specific Bayesian case, the decision boundary is determined by minimizing the Euclidean distance to the class means.

**Source:** Slide 18 (Image analysis and Pattern Recognition, Lecture 5)

**6. What is a Mahalanobis distance classifier?**

A Mahalanobis distance classifier is a type of classifier that assigns an unknown feature vector to the class whose mean (centroid) is closest to the feature vector in terms of Mahalanobis distance. The Mahalanobis distance takes into account the covariance (and thus the shape and orientation) of the data distribution for each class. This classifier arises from the Bayesian classifier when assuming that all classes follow a Gaussian distribution but have different covariance matrices ($\Sigma_i$). Minimizing the Mahalanobis distance to the class means is equivalent to maximizing the Bayesian discriminant function when the covariance matrices are different and prior probabilities are equal.

**7. What is a k-NN classifier?**

A k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm used for classification. It classifies a new data point based on the majority class of its $k$ nearest neighbors in the training dataset. The algorithm does not explicitly learn a model during training but rather stores the training data. When a new, unlabeled data point is presented, the classifier calculates the distance between this new point and all points in the training set, identifies the $k$ closest points, and assigns the new point to the class that is most frequent among these $k$ neighbors. Slide 19 of Lecture 5 introduces the k-NN classifier.

**8. What is a linear perceptron and how can we train it?**

A linear perceptron is a simple supervised learning algorithm for binary classification. It is a type of linear classifier that learns a linear decision boundary to separate two classes. The decision boundary is defined by a weight vector $w$ and a bias (or threshold) $w_0$. For a given input feature vector $x$, the perceptron computes a weighted sum of the inputs and compares it to the threshold: $w^T x + w_0$. The input is assigned to one class if the result is positive and to the other class if it is negative. Slide 21 of Lecture 5 describes the linear discriminant function and the role of $w$ and $w_0$.

A linear perceptron can be trained using the perceptron learning algorithm, which is an iterative optimization process based on gradient descent. Slide 22 of Lecture 5 outlines the training process. The algorithm updates the weight vector based on misclassified training examples. If a training example $x$ from class $\omega_1$ is misclassified (i.e., $w^T x + w_0 < 0$), the weights are updated to increase the output for this example. If a training example $x$ from class $\omega_2$ is misclassified (i.e., $w^T x + w_0 \ge 0$), the weights are updated to decrease the output. The update rule is proportional to the misclassified example and a learning rate $\rho_t$. Slide 22 of Lecture 5 provides the update rule. The algorithm converges if the data is linearly separable.

**9. What is a Multi-layer perceptron?**

A Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network that consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Unlike a simple linear perceptron, MLPs use non-linear activation functions in the hidden layers, which allows them to learn and represent complex, non-linear relationships in the data and classify data that is not linearly separable. Each neuron in one layer is typically fully connected to all neurons in the adjacent layers. MLPs are trained using algorithms like backpropagation, which adjusts the weights and biases of the connections based on the error between the network's output and the desired output. Slide 24 and 25 of Lecture 5 illustrate the architecture of MLPs and their ability to handle non-linearly separable data like the XOR function.

**10. What is supervised and non-supervised classification?**

**Supervised Classification:** In supervised classification, the training data consists of input feature vectors and their corresponding known class labels. The goal is to learn a mapping from the feature space to the class labels. The algorithm uses this labeled training data to build a model that can predict the class label for new, unseen feature vectors. Slide 6 of Lecture 5 explains supervised classifiers and gives examples like Bayesian classifiers and neural networks.

**Unsupervised Classification:** In unsupervised classification (also known as clustering), the training data consists of input feature vectors without any corresponding class labels. The goal is to discover inherent groupings or structures (clusters) within the data based on the similarity of the feature vectors. The algorithm identifies these clusters without prior knowledge of the classes. Slide 6 of Lecture 5 explains unsupervised classifiers and mentions clustering algorithms.

**11. What is non-supervised classification and describe the k-means algorithm?**

**Non-supervised classification**, also known as clustering, is a machine learning task where the goal is to group a set of data points into clusters such that data points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. This is done without prior knowledge of the class labels for the data points. Slide 6 of Lecture 5 describes unsupervised classification as grouping similar vectors to create clusters.

The **k-means algorithm** is a popular iterative algorithm for non-supervised classification that partitions a dataset into a predefined number of $k$ clusters. The objective of the k-means algorithm is to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (the sum of squared distances between data points and the centroid of their assigned cluster).

The algorithm works as follows: Slide 31 of Lecture 5 outlines the ISODATA (k-means) algorithm steps.
1.  **Initialization:** Choose the number of clusters $k$. Randomly initialize $k$ cluster centroids in the data space.
2.  **Assignment:** Assign each data point to the nearest cluster centroid based on a distance metric (commonly Euclidean distance).
3.  **Update:** Recalculate the position of each cluster centroid as the mean of all data points assigned to that cluster.
4.  **Repeat:** Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the cluster centroids no longer move significantly or a predefined number of iterations is reached.

The algorithm aims to converge to a state where the assignments of data points to clusters are stable. Slide 32 of Lecture 5 shows examples of k-means clustering.
